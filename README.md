# Smart Banking Services

## A Bank Graphical User Interface project based on Python Tkinter library

### Overview

This project is a comprehensive banking application designed to provide a secure and user-friendly banking experience. It integrates various functionalities, including GUI interfaces, RFID technology for secure authentication/identification, and email notifications.

### Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a secure and user-friendly banking application that incorporates RFID technology for user authentication, a graphical user interface (GUI) for various banking operations, and automated email notifications via SMTP. Additionally, the project employs SQLite for efficient database management.

This project aims to:

- Teach the basics of GUI design using Tkinter.
- Demonstrate database management with SQLite.
- Explore secure user authentication through RFID technology.
- Implement automated email notifications using SMTP.

This project is intended for educational purposes only and is not a fully-fledged industry-ready banking application. It provides basic functionalities compared to modern banking solutions and serves as an introductory platform for beginner developers/programmers to learn about these technologies.

### Description

This multi-functional banking application leverages advanced technologies to offer an efficient and secure banking experience. The application combines RFID technology for secure user authentication, Tkinter for a graphical user interface, SQLite for database management, and SMTP for sending email notifications. The system aims to simplify and secure personal and small business banking operations.

### Functionalities

1.  **User Authentication via RFID and Security Pin:**

    - Utilizes RFID cards or tags for user authentication.
    - Reads the RFID tagâ€™s unique ID to identify which bank account belongs to the user.
    - Ensures secure access to authorized users only.

2.  **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**

    - Developed using Python's Tkinter library.
    - Main window provides navigation options for various banking operations.
    - Separate windows for each banking operation (e.g., account creation, account deletion, cash deposit, cash withdrawal, amount transfer, balance inquiry).

3.  **Banking Operations:**

    - Create Account: Allows users to create new bank accounts by entering necessary details into a form.
    - Delete Account: Enables users to delete existing bank accounts.
    - Deposit Money: Facilitates depositing money into a user's account.
    - Withdraw Money: Allows users to withdraw money from their account.
    - Transfer Money: Enables transferring money between different accounts.
    - Check Balance: Provides users with the current balance of their account.

4.  **Automated Email Notifications:**

    - Sends email notifications to users for important account activities.
    - Uses SMTP with OAuth2 for secure email transmission.
    - Keeps users informed about transactions, enhancing transparency and security.

5.  **Database Management with SQLite:**

    - Uses SQLite for storing and managing user account information and transaction details.
    - Ensures data is stored securely and can be easily queried for various operations.

- SQLite: Comes with Python installations. No additional installation required.
- RFID Reader and Tags: Ensure you have compatible RFID hardware.
- Google Cloud Platform setup: Create a project on Google Cloud Platform and configure the Gmail API for email functionality. Steps given below.

#### Setting up Gmail API for SMTP

1. **Create a project in the Google Cloud Platform Console:**

   - Go to the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
   - Click on the project dropdown and select "New Project".
   - Enter a project name and click "Create".

2. **Enable the Gmail API:**

   - In the Google Cloud Platform Console, go to the "APIs & Services" > "Library".
   - Search for "Gmail API" and click on it.
   - Click "Enable".

3. **Set up the OAuth consent screen:**

   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen".
   - Choose "External" and click "Create".
   - Fill in the required information and save.

4. **Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:**

   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
   - Click "Create Credentials" and select "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs".
   - Choose "Desktop app" for the application type and click "Create".
   - Download the credentials JSON file and save it in your project directory as credentials.json.

### Project Setup
